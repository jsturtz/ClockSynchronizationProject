# ClockSynchronizationProject

Project in which I implemented Berkely TEMPO algorithm for synchronizing clocks. To prove the implementation, I used Docker to spin up containers in which each container ran a Unix operating system. Each OS runs a daemon to communicate together according to the Berkely TEMPO algorithm to maintain internal consistency of computer clocks.
