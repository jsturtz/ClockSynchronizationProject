Open issues / next steps for libfaketime development:

Please see the issue tracker on Github - https://github.com/wolfcw/libfaketime

- New features, such as additional system calls to intercept, are labelled
  "feature request" when they are considered for implementation

- Issues labelled "help wanted" should be your starting point if you are
  interested in contributing to libfaketime

Besides the open issues, two major changes are planned for the next release:

- integrate manchicken's autoconf/automake support to get rid of separate Makefile.OSX

- use the testing framework to also implement unit tests
